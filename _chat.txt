[20/06/22, 5:58:25 PM] Anshuman Chatterjee: Aren’t they trained? This is a flaw, suppose something fishy happens in the society, then as per NBH app details, there is a chance that folks are marked exited from the society.

Don’t know how effective it would be because the water will still drain through the concrete between two blocks; seepage problem might not be resolved
[21/06/22, 3:00:35 PM] Nishant Ji L-2005: This issue should be resolved on first priority otherwise it would be very problematic in future

[22/06/22, 8:55:04 AM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: Hi as has been reported, we have a covid case in J block 9th floor. Kindly get the floor corridors of entire tower as well as the lift sanitised on regular basis.
In fact since delivery and house keeping staffs are common agents to entire society. It is better to get the entire society blocks and lifts sanitised for safety of the residents.
Let us all pray for quick recovery of Sachin ji of J-901.
Also let us extend any and every kind of help to him within this period in case needed.
[22/06/22, 9:01:45 AM] Anshuman Chatterjee: As residents, we too have some duties towards the society. I encourage everyone in the common areas(park, gym, lifts, market) to wear a mask and sanitize there hands more often than not.
[22/06/22, 9:12:48 AM] ‪+91 97587 84309‬: pool bhi close ho raha hi ???
[22/06/22, 9:30:49 AM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: Agree, even all lift buttons should be sanitised multiple times a day. They are the most common touch points. The fans in the lifts are so ineffective that stale/contaminated air remains within. And is there any predecided limitations to the persons allowed inside? Standard practice is to limit four persons max in four corners. As seen in other societies during tower infection period and peak covid periods.

[22/06/22, 10:48:58 AM] ‪+91 97802 33264‬: Agree @919911622374

To, 

@918130110309
@919717495211

Gate is for residents comfort not as per choice of management

Gate should remain open during 
office hour 830-1030 am 

Afternoon when parents need to pick up their kids 
1230-130noon

Evening post 530- 930 pm 

And security guard should be active and keep his eyes and ear open to avoid any security laps 

@919810402291 uncle Ji, Pls add this topic as it becomes daily habit to arguments with security to
Open gate and I reported same
Incident to @919717495211 ji too

Early response from concern team will be highly appreciated

[22/06/22, 11:54:09 AM] ‪+91 84476 39569‬: Agreed. Just make it a wall if the gate cannot be opened. Their excuses are so childish . Honestly if a gate has broken in the past due to heavy wind it's probably coz the material they used or the way they have provisioned the glass was not correct. We had to keep travelling from one tower to another where gates are opened

[22/06/22, 11:37:05 PM] ‪+91 84370 41446‬: What was the Outlook before buying flat in nimbus? If kids can't play, why the old age people think that park is for them only, just sit idle and let all become idle, it better for them to stay in own flat premises. For clean air use own balcony.😜

It observed that many bikers and car owners speedup their vehicle from ramp toward the place they park. Day before yesterday it was a near miss. I was about to collide with a biker.

[23/06/22, 1:40:43 PM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: I didn't see any surveillance cam there. Hard to figure out.
However we need to think who are the users who do have pencils always with them. Keeping pencil is not a very commin phenomenon.
Normally pencil is used by students or by carpenters or plumbers.
[23/06/22, 1:42:03 PM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: Even students do not carry pencils always, but only when they are going out or returning from tuitions or school.
[23/06/22, 1:44:32 PM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: Exactly so, its kind of an outcome of frustrated and sick mentality. Definitely dangerous for the society. You never know whats deep within these sick people's mind.

Any update ???? 
J1-304
[24/06/22, 1:43:36 PM] Vikas Pandey Maintainence: We checked with concern team of Park +.
As per there recommendation.
1. Park plus app should be activated mode in mobile.
2. One vehicle should register in one mobile phone only means if more than one vehicle they should be in different number and mobile.. 

If still after that facing challenge pls do let us know. Regards , Vikas Pandey
[24/06/22, 1:46:43 PM] ‪+91 99119 59797‬: Yes, I have 1 number, active park+ app and 1 vehicle only.

Though I find their recommendation inefficient enough from the tech point of view, however, the RFID scanner still has an issue.
[24/06/22, 1:49:18 PM] Prasoon M1 2004: Getting it explained:

1. Same vehicle should be registered in downloaded app of the owner's mobile or primary user.

2. If a vehicle is registered in more than one mobile, RFID may not be responsive.

Technical Glitch:

Sometimes, even when registering with one way RFID do not work, we have to manually remove and add vehicle again to make it work.

It happened with me... Working all good as of now.

(some stickers are defective, which needs to be replaced or scanned properly.)

[27/06/22, 8:06:35 PM] ‪+91 99116 22374‬: If they want to permanent close...then make it will.... Why gate is required

[27/06/22, 8:13:41 PM] ‪+91 97802 33264‬: Why again and we need to raise the concern to @918130110309 
Simply wall / door is for resident ease not for dictatorship 

Kindly open the gate as per time given by Resident of M1 or if you have not received you can re discussed with us
[27/06/22, 8:18:54 PM] ‪+91 97802 33264‬: Hello @919810402291 uncle ji 
I belon this should be easiest things to done in consultation With members and Managment but still it’s open and we have no clue on why it’s so stretched ?? 

School will open soon and morning and evening we have to face difficulty due to this *dictatorship behaviour of few Nimbus managment* and gate remain closed 

Hope team or managment understand the importance else M1 Resident will take step at their own and further too
[27/06/22, 8:22:49 PM] ‪+91 99900 52857‬: Everything can not be walled in the name of security. Back gate is for convenience of the residents. In scorching sun it is very painful to use the main entry in harsh sun. It should be opened definitely. Gate hawa me tut jaega ye to koi reason nahi.
[27/06/22, 8:25:42 PM] ‪+91 99900 52857‬: @918130110309 why have you instructed the guards to keep it closed permanently. Guards says you have instructed him to keep it closed.
[27/06/22, 8:32:32 PM] ‪+91 99991 69585‬: Yes agreed .
Kindly open the back door as soon as possible .

[27/06/22, 8:51:51 PM] ‪+91 99116 22374‬: It is not the excuse that gate will broken in high wind that' why we locked the same.. why we are giving maintenance....

@918826984346

- If guard can’t up and open and door close 
- Guard can’t do security 
- Team can’t handle society issues 
-  nimbus can’t install glass in lifts which is pending from years 

So are we giving CAM for *Garbage collection* only  ???

All resident need to think on *CAM charges* we are not here to pay for other benefits when our own comfort and easy on stake
[27/06/22, 9:37:01 PM] ‪+91 91 40 6893 23‬: By the way if door is closed then it's surface area focused to wind is maximum therefore the chances of door to break will be maximum.
This excuse is not working
[27/06/22, 9:51:34 PM] ‪+91 99100 33654‬: Good one
[27/06/22, 10:00:51 PM] ‪+91 70170 40868‬: We don’t need doors if it is so fragile. Wether Replace these doors by iron doors or starts some kind of cab and auto service from M1 tower to the main gate. Hawa chalegi to gate break ho jayega to ye baat gate lagane se pahle ni pata thi ya jab gate ni laga tha tab yahn nimbus m hawa chalti hi ni thi or jabse gate laga h tabhi hawa ne decide kiya h ki ye glass doors break kr k rahegi.

Dated: 28.06.2022

Dear Residents, 

Greetings of the day !!

In continuation of our earlier circulars pertains to community living and make our society is the best place to live. 

We would like to inform you that in past few days we were observed that few of our flat occupants throwing out objects i.e. garbage bags, water bottles , liquor bottles ,sanitary napkins , tea coffee mugs , wastage of fruits and vegetables from their flats windows and balconies to other flats area or common areas i.e. Plumbing shaft , tower surrounding areas etc. 
In yesterday incident of bottle throwing from flat  infront of tower. We raised complaint to the concern authority to take action and as per them they will obtain  finger print from that bottle and do necessary investigation and further course of action. 
At the time of investigation they will tk finger print from the concern tower occupants and do strict action . 

It's advisable and recommend to all pls avoid throwing any object from your flat to any common areas, if still found doing the same penalty and strict action to be taken against concern person.  

Appreciate your extended support to make our society is the best place to live with collective efforts. 

Thanks and Regards ,

Matlab hadd hai! Students jyada daraa rahe hai inhe!
[28/06/22, 9:29:35 PM] ‪+91 99116 22374‬: Security useless hai..koi fayda nhi hai security ka..
[28/06/22, 9:30:49 PM] ‪+91 95997 83213‬: I appreciate this poor security guard for being honest, but major goofup is on his seniors as to what's their responsibility towards their team and job..if he is failing in some activity where is his senior supporting him..the larger ownership is with builder and security leaders..
[28/06/22, 9:34:19 PM] ‪+91 98915 41549‬: I agree 👍
[28/06/22, 9:36:39 PM] ‪+91 97681 76560‬: Security chief himself is not aggressive stating not getting support from Nimbus.

[28/06/22, 9:48:55 PM] ‪+91 99998 82672‬: Kisi bhi tower ki lift ma fan kaam nahi kar rahaa hai sirf dekhawa hai  ka fan chal raha hai

[28/06/22, 9:52:29 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: We are living in a such a ace where the security is ZERO and no one is serious about the same..... Only pages full of rules and regulations are made and nothing us followed.... RFID stickers only a rule is made and i still see so many vehicles still entering the society without the same..... Sometimes it looks like that main gate security simply opens the gate..... God help us....

[28/06/22, 10:01:30 PM] ‪+91 99074 68996‬: If someone is telling truth, it's good. Nimbus management should be ashamed for pitiable conditions of its security taking hard earned money of residents.

Inconvenience regretted. 
Appreciate your support in this regard . 
Regards , Vikas Pandey
[01/07/22, 11:17:45 AM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: The guards on basement parking management need to be properly briefed on security of car ingress and egress. I myself faced face to face situations while exit over the steep incline, for fresh drivers it will be a challenging situation. And guards were not even there to manage. There is only one convex safety mirror for the entry driver, nothing for the exit drivers to be aware except manual guidance of the guards. So they should be alert.
Also its important for drivers to keep left while approaching the ingress egress to basement.
[01/07/22, 11:22:34 AM] ‪+91 98681 71864‬: It's permanent  solution to make entry and exit separately as exit is ready
[01/07/22, 11:25:19 AM] ‪+91 98681 71864‬: What does it mean .please  clarify your views
[01/07/22, 11:30:26 AM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: True, that is understood, but we need to ensure safety till then. We cant wait till a collision takes place. If not system driven at least manual guidance of guards from both the fronts. Which is seen occasionally and not full time.
[01/07/22, 11:31:31 AM] ‪+91 84476 39569‬: True, so many times the guards are missing. They even allow cars and bikes to come n go in parallel
[01/07/22, 11:35:43 AM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: I am sure lot of residents avoid basement for all such inconveniences regarding basement parking. I myself have faced it so many times. Also the bikers need to be a bit patient and cautious. I have seen young boys overtake when i am driving up or down the ramp, why so much hurry?, I understand that you cant control the decent like cars do, so you need to pull up with a smaller engine in lower gear, but in that case one should wait till the ramp is clear!
[01/07/22, 11:36:23 AM] ‪+91 94100 87047‬: Today I came to know, that after sharing this video the guard was immediately fired to show the action taken. 

When I was making this video he was alone performing his duty at the gate. He told everything truth. 

He was doing what is briefed to him. Main problem is that the guards doesn't know their key responsibilities.

The real culprits are others who doesn't want security at the gate. Because of them even after repeated messages RFID are not being applied.

@919717495211 Maintenance team is not pasting RFID's properly, which allows them to reuse it. Proof shared personally. But still no response received.

I request Adhoc committee members to please work out some strict actions with senior management to improve the security. 🙏

[01/07/22, 1:04:51 PM] ‪+91 95605 54343‬: Still it doesn't makes sense to block space for 2 cars... If for suppose a bike was parked, car could have been parked in another slot
[01/07/22, 1:09:23 PM] ‪+91 99904 12921‬: May be bike was there
This car may park in the sense in parking row 
Now this car acupied two rows
Hanse this is wrong parking
That's all
[01/07/22, 1:13:50 PM] ‪+91 99119 59797‬: There are hardly any empty slots late night, Pranav ji.
Its probably a bad idea to put the blame of wrong parking on WagonR guy which resulted due to the incorrect parking of the bike.

I notice this almost everyday.

Not very sure of what is the best way to bring this in shape, but I definitely think that a lot of people go ahead with incorrect parking since its not right to park in open area adjacent to the buildings.

Agreed that we have our security in bad shape, but its the duty of the people to hold on to civic sense.

Either criticise or come together and help each other. 
With all due respect 🙏🏻

So it is not possible you all residents can get security facilities

[01/07/22, 1:30:51 PM] ‪+91 98681 71864‬: It's  easy to criticize better to come on ground as an volunteer  and show your efficient work.It will be highly appreciated
[01/07/22, 1:30:56 PM] ‪+91 99900 52857‬: I also agree with you
[01/07/22, 1:32:03 PM] ‪+91 98732 49363‬: Absolutely right, if someone has issues come on ground and help everyone to solve it with mutual understanding
[01/07/22, 1:33:25 PM] ‪+91 99904 12921‬: If you all are residents satisfied with the security performance then why are you raising the points??????
[01/07/22, 1:34:35 PM] ‪+91 98732 49363‬: Because it is still not at its best, it has improved in last one month, however there is still lot of scope for improvement. We are just trying to address that
[01/07/22, 1:36:04 PM] ‪+91 99904 12921‬: The culprit netas ( residents) 
Know  about them selves
[01/07/22, 1:41:06 PM] Prasoon M1 2004: Hukum Singh ji, we stand with you as you are trying to get the security at the next level of betterment. For any issue if occurs do let me know. We are not asking for justification only but also supporting to get it done at the earliest..
[01/07/22, 1:46:19 PM] ‪+91 98681 71864‬: Sabhi apne jaise najar aate hai.please avoid unparliamentry language.
[01/07/22, 1:46:50 PM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: I too feel that bike parking should be a dedicated space so as not to waste space that could have been utilised to park a 4 wheeler.
In case there is a dedicated space it should be clearly marked so that even 4 wheelers do not squeeze into that space.

Just a suggestion to address concerns of both the views.
[01/07/22, 1:48:58 PM] ‪+91 95605 54343‬: 👍🏼 with you
[01/07/22, 1:51:10 PM] ‪+91 99900 52857‬: Why not the parking should be allocated properly to each flat owner? Wouldn't it be better
[01/07/22, 1:56:00 PM] ‪+91 99904 12921‬: Mere jaise sabhi ho jaye

[01/07/22, 2:00:48 PM] ‪+91 99116 22374‬: Yes
[01/07/22, 2:01:41 PM] Prasoon M1 2004: Have personally also asked him to get all the four wheelers details who have dust and without RFID so that we can get the basement cleared to the best... 🙏
[01/07/22, 2:04:39 PM] ‪+91 98732 49363‬: How come they they are earning money. Do you have any proof? Or who said that to you. You can't blame anyone like this. Everyone here except you saud that they are happy with the improvement in Security and still there is scope of improvement. However it looks to me that you are not able to digest that. Please think twice before you blame anyone next time.

Dear Residents, 

Greetings of the day !!

In continuation of our earlier circulars pertains to community living and make our society is the best place to live. 

We would like to inform you that in past few days we were observed that few of our flat occupants throwing out objects i.e. garbage bags, water bottles , liquor bottles ,sanitary napkins , tea coffee mugs , wastage of fruits and vegetables from their flats windows and balconies to other flats area or common areas i.e. Plumbing shaft , tower surrounding areas etc. 
In yesterday incident of bottle throwing from flat  infront of tower. We raised complaint to the concern authority to take action and as per them they will obtain  finger print from that bottle and do necessary investigation and further course of action. 
At the time of investigation they will tk finger print from the concern tower occupants and do strict action . 

It's advisable and recommend to all pls avoid throwing any object from your flat to any common areas, if still found doing the same penalty and strict action to be taken against concern person.  

*Appreciate residents and committee members extended support to make our society is the best place to live with collective efforts*.

It was taken up with Senior Management and GM of Civil work
It was decided by working committee to take help of  technical people from society to know the actual plan of Nimbus to control complete seepage 
Thanks to Mr Yashpal Singh, Architect, who consented for discussion and also thanks to Mr Rajiv jain who invited an expert from Adani Group construction 
A meeting was held after Mr Yashpal and expert from Adani group inspected expansion joints and Basement 
Mr Saxena,GM Civil works of Nimbus, and Mr Jamal came to explain the procedure being followed to control seepage
Mr Saxena explained technical work planned by them, however when asked he did admit that that it shall control 90 percent of seepage and rest will b controlled on point basis
Moreover nothing much could b done during rains 
After lots of technical discussion it was decided to have next meeting on next Saturday with all the drawings and maps and a plan to control hundred percent seepage 
Mr Anand Saini too came out with some suggestions on his experience in construction 
Besides Mr Yashpal and an expert from Adanis the meeting was attended by Mr Attri,Mr Rajpal,Mr Saini,Mr Rajiv Jain,Mr Vivek Gupta,Mr Neeraj Sachan and myself

[04/07/22, 12:24:22 PM] ‪+91 99119 59797‬: @919717495211 FYI

Parkwheel was acquired by Park+

Therefore, people can have:
1. *Old Parkwheel RFID tag*
or
2. *Park+ small RFID stickers* issued by some other body (example their office, some other society etc)
or
3. *Park+ RFID by Nimbus*.

These old tags can be authorised by the Maintenance staff to work as the new one are working.
For example: I use my Parkwheel tag to use in office and society and a few other places.

Kindly educate the security guards about this matter during their briefing this evening.

PS: Good to see @917409625182 and guards putting this in force mandatorily.🙏🏻

[04/07/22, 10:16:16 PM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: @917409625182 ji, today again basement se nikalte waqt 90% upar ane ke baad ek gari niche ki taraf a gayee, aur itni narrow passage usne insist kiya ki mai pass karun.

Mere gari me lage bhi.

Maine baad me basement Guard se baat bhi ki. Aap ekbar unse please baat karein, pura incident unse bhi pata karein, aur iska hal nikale.
Maine ye issue pehle bhi uthaya hai.
Ye mere saath aage hua to mujhe apni aur gari ke safety ke liye wahi gari rok dena parega jab tak age ka rasta clear na ho, fir passage jam ho sakta hai aur baat kisi dusre resident ke sath tu tu mai mai tak bhi ja sakti hai.

Isse achha hai ki iska timely solution ho aur sab me shanti bani rahe.

Maine guards ko ye bhi pucha ke unhone us gadi ki number li kya, par unhone kaha ki saab hamari koi sunta nehi. Maine unse kaha ki kuch aisi dekhe to agar gadiwale ko na bhi kahe par number aur time zaroor note karein so that baad me kuch reference mile.

And i am not sure ki koi CC tv coverage hoti ki nehi is passage me ane jane wali gadion ki.
Aap please pata karein.

[04/07/22, 11:35:29 PM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: Also hand signalling might not be visible enough for some drivers as in todays case the driver didnt seem to follow the parking safety mirror else he could have easily spotted my car which was already midway up. It will be good to have Traffic Safety Baton Light with 2 Flashing Modes (Red & Green) to assist drivers. Just a suggestion. Rest you can check on with other WC members and agency on feasibility ground.
[04/07/22, 11:37:19 PM] ‪+91 97487 31713‬: It looks like this a nd comes handy and budget friendly as well.
[05/07/22, 7:27:25 AM] ‪+91 98104 02291‬: Safety Baton light is the right safety device till separate exit  / entry is arranged
It will b ensured in this week meeting with senior Management that Batons r provided to guards in Basement entry and exit
[05/07/22, 7:27:27 AM] ‪+91 97174 93836‬: Water flowing from drawing room balcony all the night, please check and take permanent solution for it.

[05/07/22, 7:28:42 AM] ‪+91 97174 93836‬: Road partition might also help around it
[05/07/22, 7:32:49 AM] ‪+91 98104 02291‬: As there is separate entry and exit and same is likely to b permitted soon,partition is not a choice moreover it is not feasable
I m writing to Mr Asopa right now for arranging light flickering batons
[05/07/22, 7:48:54 AM] ‪+91 99074 68996‬: True and if expedite then better.

Kal ek maid aayi wo 2k maang rhi hai cleaning and utensils ka without dusting. Jab dusting ka bola to bolti hai 1500 extra lagenge. Jab lut hi macha hai to regulations laake kya faayda??
[05/07/22, 8:48:52 AM] ‪+91 95602 74344‬: L1 tower’s extension number is no working pls do the needful
[05/07/22, 9:39:53 AM] ‪+91 99998 82672‬: 1 - Maids are not ready to work below 2500
2- Suddenly they rushed up to full day work in the middle
3- Timings should be fixed for these maids like an office hours
4- Rates should be fixed by the management whether 2000 or 2500 with all the work like bathroom included
4- Make one committee of the residents regarding these maids issue
5- lady Guard should be given strict instructions not to enter the maid if they are charging high if she does so then strict action should be taken against her
6- If got 3 complaints of any of the maid then entry should be banned
7-If any maid leaves any work of PRC resident saying that she is not well or due to her marriage and found working in some other house she should be banned
8-Maids cannot change work within 6 months
[05/07/22, 9:54:28 AM] ‪+91 99100 52737‬: Correct. They are exploiting our dependency on them. 
Also there should be no entry without a valid entry pass issued by Security. In case of multiple jobs all households should know where else their maid is working.
[05/07/22, 10:02:56 AM] ‪+91 98681 71864‬: No doubt but what can we do to improve asAO can control  not builder.so we are helpless to implement all rules and regulations. We can try all should come together

[05/07/22, 12:50:50 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: @919717495211 what about issues raised in a formal email related to non payment of CAM and that not being answered by anyone officially? Who would be responsible for the delay in addressing the same? Its been close to 2 years I have been following up with concerned people related to the issues of my flat and no one even bothered to come and solve it.........Issues does not get solved by people coming and having a simple look at it, things have to be done on ground...........Have sent many reminders also...........Please update me on the same............

[05/07/22, 1:04:36 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: If there is no answer from Maintainence team as well as Laxmi Nagar office for the emails sent to them time and again with reminders that means there is no interest at anyones end (NIMBUS/MAINTAINENCE TEAM) to solve the same.......and if no one is interested to solve it then WHY SHOULD CAM BE PAID? Can someone answer this..............We saw the pathetic condition of the basement as well as situation of the Security very recently.............
[05/07/22, 1:04:38 PM] ‪+91 95605 54343‬: Lift condition in L1 tower is really very pathetic... The fan is barely working... Very difficult to stand even for couple of minutes @919717495211
[05/07/22, 1:06:51 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: @919717495211 This is a Live Example of the condition of Lifts and is the condition in all towers........If lifts cant be maintained unlike what it is in the Club area then sorry I have not paid for SHODDY LIFTS while buying the flat and would not pay CAM for such Shoddy lifts.............I think it applies to many residents who are experiencing continuous issues with Lifts on a daily basis
[05/07/22, 1:08:05 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: Instead of posting this illogical circulars I have suggested in the past to Mr R S Aggarwal also please find out why people are not paying CAM? But as usual no one is bothered to do this exercise as the issues are not with residents, rather the issues are with NIMBUS
[05/07/22, 1:11:14 PM] Anshuman Chatterjee: The classic chicken egg problem. Maintainence team says we can’t funtion when there is no money. And residents say why should we pay if our problems aren’t answered.

Lack of communication between management and residents will take things nowhere.
[05/07/22, 1:13:18 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: There is no communication gap anywehere..........As a resident when I paid 100% for my flat I was promised some basic facilities (facilites as per their recent brochure) and if they are not done even after 3 years of shifting then intent is the problem and not communication..................
[05/07/22, 1:15:10 PM] Anshuman Chatterjee: I meant that your mails aren’t responded. Even my mails for registry hasn’t been responded to from epv2care.
[05/07/22, 1:15:54 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: Exactly...............They think we are fools writing emails to them and they wont respond..............
[05/07/22, 1:16:15 PM] ‪+91 95602 74344‬: Being a permanent residents of L1 Nimbus 2 , may I know the reason behind back door close orders and who has given such orders. Come down from your Ac facilitied cabins and check the temperature outside. Kids have to take long way while coming from school even when they already exhausted in school busses. We brought home here to follow such instructions /orders. 
I don’t know the reason behind such order but it has to be open during school hours morning/afternoon.
[05/07/22, 1:18:47 PM] ‪+91 99116 22374‬: @918130110309 @919717495211 @918826984346  pls look out this matter
[05/07/22, 1:19:13 PM] ‪+91 95605 54343‬: Agreed ....we as residents can't always be on d receiving side... Basic amenities is what we r expecting , then can't understand where is d gap

[05/07/22, 1:23:41 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: @919810402291 Uncle, @919868171864 Uncle being in the Ad Hoc Committee please let me know what needs to be done as no one has replied to my emails

Everything has a solution. May be timings of the door could be managed to undergo the situations as below:
1. Morning office timings/ School timings.
2. Noon School timings as kids have to walk long through this high temperature.
3. Evening hours.

If in case in any of these listed timings, weather is bad or we have  high winds- gate can be closed with keys with guard. Please make an amendment with proper output.🙏

[05/07/22, 2:20:16 PM] ‪+91 78358 53708‬: I tower saft cleaning work done
[05/07/22, 2:21:49 PM] ‪+91 98104 02291‬: There r certain common issues like Cameras in basement,parking Allotment ,security and few more which have already been taken up by Committe and being addressed to also by builder
As regds yr personal issue of bathroom slope ,shall ask Vikas Pandey the reason for delay and to b rectified at the earliest
You may go for FIR if not satisfies
Take advantage of SCHEME FOR waive off of Penalty etc
[05/07/22, 2:32:00 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: Uncle penalty waiver would have to be done once work gets over cos delay is not on my side..... I have sent you emails also which clearly states that I am following with all the people on ground from May 2020....its been two years and pls note that i have paid one year advance CAM when o tool possession of flat in Aug 18 and have paid CAM for one year more after the advance got exhausted.... So it's not that my intention is not to pay but people at Nimbus can't be asking for CAM without doing on ground.... My car cover worth 1600 has got stolen from th basement so I would want that to be deducted from CAM payable by me as no one has bothered to give me any update..... manish srivastava was looking into it and now he has gone and so is the matter........i feel casual attitude is the challenge....
[05/07/22, 2:37:38 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: Also as per Vikas Pandey their Mason is not so much qualified/experienced to put the tiles in such a way that the slope is perfect...... So I am not at fault in this situation also......
[05/07/22, 2:40:39 PM] Anshuman Chatterjee: Have you spoken to Rajeev Sharma Ji from Possesion Team? He is a gentleman and has helped me with almost all of my flats issues that were pending even after possession was taken by me.

Although there were a lot of followups that were taken by ne, but one by one, all matters were resolved.
[05/07/22, 2:42:07 PM] ‪+91 97112 57845‬: Let me tell you about one interesting quote "we don't bother about residents peace or safety instead our business here"

By Mr. Upadhyay
[05/07/22, 2:54:52 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: Wow tell him to give this in writing so thay we can also keep a record
[05/07/22, 2:59:35 PM] ‪+91 97802 33264‬: Bussiness will only work if we as resident are residing here if we left from here he will left with zero business
[05/07/22, 3:02:52 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: Exactly
[05/07/22, 3:04:04 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: Real estate business runs with word of mouth reference and if you don't deliver then no one would refer and no one would buy also your flats
[05/07/22, 3:05:11 PM] ‪+91 97112 57845‬: Infact I was talking about the park issues between J & K Tower when he told me in this way. I told him that inspite of repeated reminder to management the park is still not in place even after 4 years while the same was promised and shown into nimbus broachers (with signed copy) when we bought this flat. then he became so rude and replied in very bad manner as above
[05/07/22, 3:06:29 PM] ‪+91 98105 13865‬: Don't want to comment on their attitude...... As I have faced also...
[05/07/22, 3:07:23 PM] ‪+91 95602 74344‬: @918826984346 @918130110309 @919717495211 dear concern … response is awaiting though I don’t require your response but appropriate action instead. If you guys implement any orders even for residents benefits please take residents consent also. Hope from tomorrow onwards we don’t need to messages you or call you for such basic amenities.
[05/07/22, 3:08:53 PM] ‪+91 97112 57845‬: pls read as green area instead of  park

[06/07/22, 1:45:33 PM] ‪+91 98104 02291‬: Just spoke to Mr Tariq Jamal about alteration in flats 
He informed me that only Brick work has been altered and NO BEAM OR COLUMN IS TOUCHED ,Being Non technical I m not qualified to comment on this 
He also mentioned about another  case of alteration about 8 months back too and it was discussed with Mr Asopa too by Committe and on checking by technical persons it was found that only Brick work is broken,
I m not sure of present case whether it is only case of Bricks alteration  or of Beam or Column
Since this is very serious matter and safety  of residents and building is involved ,we should  take up only after inspection by qualified team 
Moreover Builder should confirm if any permission was taken for alteration by these unqualified contractors for alteration or doing at their own
Nimbus staff to confirm to working committe  that these aleration r being done with prior approval of them or at the pleasure of Contractor 
Let us take advice of Technically qualified team before we proceed for further action
I m writing to Nimbus to confirm if alteration r being done with their prior approval and they r submitted drawing of alteration and they check up that alteration is as per drawing submitted

If the contractor does not have written permission of builder with drawing, Contractor b told to stop the alteration

There have been concern of Residents in many Towers that unauthorized alteration is being done in some Tower and even Beams and Columns r not spared, Vendors/ contractors r doing all this without keeping safety in mind
Most of the labourers and Vendors r unqualified and do any thing and everything without realizing consequences 
To put an end to this, yr attention is drawn to Clause  7,13 of Allotment letter where  minor alteration if any has to b done should b with prior approval of the Builder
You shall appreciate that this can not b done without drawing of alteration Nimbus may confirm that these alteration r being done 
with their approval and a check is done periodically to ensure that only permitted alteration as per drawing submitted by vendor is done

@Rajiv Asopa, Instructions may ol b issued to site staff to check that no alteration is being done without their approval and perodic check of the alteration b done

Dear Residents, 

Greetings of the day !!

In continuation of our earlier circulars pertains to community living and make our society is the best place to live. 

We would like to inform you that in past few days we were observed that few of our flat occupants throwing out objects i.e. garbage bags, water bottles , liquor bottles ,sanitary napkins , tea coffee mugs , wastage of fruits and vegetables from their flats windows and balconies to other flats area or common areas i.e. Plumbing shaft , tower surrounding areas etc. 
In earlier incident of bottle throwing from flat  infront of tower. We raised complaint to the concern authority to take action and as per them they will obtain  finger print from that bottle and do necessary investigation and further course of action. 
At the time of investigation they will tk finger print from the concern tower occupants and do strict action . 
*For identifying the flat/person those throwing garbage or other objects in shaft and other areas we activated surveillance system* .

*It's advisable and recommend to all pls avoid throwing any object from your flat to any common areas, if still found doing the same penalty and strict action to be taken against concern person.* 

Appreciate your extended support to make our society is the best place to live with collective efforts. 

Thanks and Regards ,

1. No manual gate opening/ closing.

2. We know not all vehicles have RFID, let them wait- request them to have RFID and then let them enter with proper verification.

3. In cases, where the main gate does not open- verify the park+ tag  , for no park+ tag only proper verification with ownership can make the vehicle enter.

No one should be treated badly, but also Security cannot be compromised. I am sure no one have any objection in this.

Senior Kone Engineer was called and told in No uncertain terms that lifts have become nightmare for Residents.Tariq Jamal and Vikas Pandey from builder side were present.
He was told bluntly that these lifts seems to b old and refurbished ones as having problem everyday.He did accept that certain parts were not available hence delay.However he added that  trash and water material of construction/renovation is put in lift without being properly packed and small part of trash and waste material passes through space to lifts moving/ electronic  parts  and effects lifts.Mr Jamal was told to instruct Securiry to keep a check on movement of trash and instruct Cleaning staff too.
Kone Engineer was asked to keep stock of spares handy so that there is No delay.Mr Jamal clearly told Kone Engineer to improve Maintenance otherwise Nimbus will go for other option.
Kone Engineer was told to give status of spares and repairs in next 2 days.
Mr Attri,Mr KK Sharma,Mr Rajiv Jain and myself were present from working Committee.

[20/07/22, 12:40:37 PM] Gaurav M-2006: At least during office hours complaints should get acknowledged and noted for later resolution.

*It's 12:30 now and no acknowledgment.* Why do people use motorbikes & cabs on walkways, why are guards not in central park after 11pm, why 4 guards chatting in front of a single tower (they don't have assigned their duties?), why are people spitting gutkha from the balcony (lift lobby area & in corners), why lifts are failing again and again, why we are operating the main gate manually, etc.

I am not sure someone is really observing the WhatsApp group on regular basis. Yes, this must be a tedious task to get a reply to each message but at least complaints can be marked/replied to.

[20/07/22, 1:27:54 PM] Anshuman Chatterjee: Hello Kone Team,

I am escalating this mail as a resident of IITL Nimbus Express Parkview 2. We are facing many issues related to your Kone lifts that have forced us to highlight these to you directly.

To begin with, there are 10 towers of 21 floors each with 20 Kone lifts altogether in our society. However, every now and then we are having lift breakdowns and multiple times in a week Mr Sanjay(engineer from your side) is taking downtime for Maintainence. Not sure whether they are Preventive or Corrective.

Next I am listing down some of the common issues here and waiting for your plan for resolution for the same.

- Sometimes both Lift failure in J, L and other towers
- Free fall of lifts in L tower
- Mr Sanjay says he spends 15-20 days every month at our society.
- Fans don’t work properly on any lift.
- Lifts making noise and vibrations on some floors
- Many residents also feel that the lifts looks like some refurbished products that uses non genuine parts during service

In addition, we expect you to audit the tickets that were raised in the last 3 months and check whether the SLAs were breached or not.

Furthermore, we agree that we should question our Maintainence Team and they should question you, but we are forced to escalate the matter with you as our Maintainence team has said that they have already informed the same to Gr Noida Head of Kone and assurances were made for rectification which we don’t see to be working.

Further, i also invite you to propose any challenges that you are facing from either Nimbus team or from residents practice so that we can resolve issues once and for all.

EPV2 Team,
We will be forced to go to RERA if our concerns are not answered.

[23/07/22, 4:23:01 PM] ‪+91 98104 02291‬: Adhoc Committee was formed by Residents of EPV-2 in GBM to resolve pending issues and improve living conditions in Society.
Inspite of repeated reminders to Management  at various level  to resolve the issues of residents no concrete solution has come from Builder side.

Main issues pending for long are as follows and require Immediate attention.If same r not attended to and resolved ,RESIDENTS WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RESORT TO PEACEFUL AGITATION AT MAIN GATE AND AT SALES OFFICE.
Media too shall b invited  if need b to express Builder failure to resolve the issues.Main issues r once again put in black and white.

1.LIFTS: Lift have become nightmare for the Residents as there is not a day when all the lifts of all the Towers r operational. At times both the lifts r out of orders of some towers and residents have to wait for hours.What will b plight of Residents staying on higher floor.There have been cases of FREE FALL OF LIFTS,a scary situation.At time spares r not available and no fans working.
It appears that  LIFTS R BEYOND CONTRACT TERM REPAIR AS THESE  R OLD REFURBISHED LIFTS AND NOTHING BUT COMPLETE OVERHAUL OR REPLACEMENT WILL ONLY WORK.

2.SEEPAGE IN BASEMENT: This is very SERIOUS and creating not only parking problem in Basement BUT REDUCING LIFE OF TOWERS AS THERE is WATER  SEEPAGE IN TO BEAMS AND COLUMNS AND IS VERY DANGEROUS AND MAY PROVE FATAL IF NOT ATTENDED TO RIGHT WAY.Present working on seepage is not fool proof and admitted by your GM Civil in meeting.Our Architect is  looking forward for drawing/Charts.

3.SEEPAGE IN FLATS AND TOWER WALLS: Seepage in flats,breaking of water pipes and seepage on external walls of Tower gives an impression that low quality material is used in construction of towers and construction is really poor and Maintenance team is helpless at times.
Nothing can b done about quality of material now but definitely  PROFESSIONAL team of MAINTENANCE can b employed, however we r at pain to add that yr present MAINTENANCE team is far from PROFESSIONAL.

PARKING: Still awaiting for Parking Allotment.

SECURITY: There has been marginal improvement in security but requires much more.No of personal in Basement Parking got to b increased and so at the gate.More Cameras got to b installed.Cameras on top of Tower as agreed in last meeting have not yet been installed.There have been cases of throwing bottles from some flats,specially in Tower I,could not b recorded as there is No camera on top of Tower.

REGISTRY:This is a major issue as residents r getting sleepless nights as the property is still NOT in their name after putting all their earnings.

BIOMETRIC/CARD SYSTEM AT GATE TO SHOPPING PLAZA: There r unauthorized  entry from shopping area to society through this gate so immedite action to check unauthorized entry is required. 
There r many other issues viz flooring of kid playing area,covering of drainage,lights in corridor, slding doors in shafts etc which have been pending for long.

If an AMICABLE SOLUTION is not given on priority, PEACEFUL AGITATION, Approaching RERA and resorting to  LEGAL authority will only b choice left for Residents
HOPE MANAGEMENT TAKES THE POINTS SERIOUSLY.
WE SEEK MEETING WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO UPDATE COMMITTEE ABOUT STEPS TAKEN BY MANAGEMENT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES FAILING WHICH WE SHALL B FORCED TO THE OPTIONS STATED ABOVE.

1 - Lifts are a pain, and despite of asking audit reports none have been presented. At the outset, the engineers, Sahu Ji dismissed the issue of *Free Falling* of lifts in the L Tower. However, after the meeting the same issue was reproduced among residents, Sahu Ji, Vikas Pandey Ji & Kone Engineer and they then accepted the issue.

2- Fans in the lifts are either faulty or needs service. Maintenance Team claimed that they had ordered *HighSpeed Fans* and would receive the same in 2 weeks time. And the photo that was shared by Anshuman was of some other lift spare part and not of Fans that the maintenance team was unaware of.

3- Kone Team said that they will be doing a re-audit of the lifts and shall share the issues to Nimbus only and not the society residents directly. However, a similar audit has already been done by Kone last month for only.

4- *Stone fitting* in lifts has been *halted* as of now due to weight issue. Though hard to digest, how the lift can malfunction due to a stone marble that won’t be heavier than 1  human being. Maintainence Team shall come back on this with proposal.


5- *Ultimatum* was given by the residents and the members who were present for the Basement Water Leakage due to expansion joints, Registry Issue, Security & Parking issues that we will jointly *protest* or even complaint to *RERA & Gr Noida Authority*. 

Surprisingly, the above point was *refuted in a humorous way by a senior member of the estate* saying that they have been hearing this for years.

Our take from this was *until all the residents, the adhoc teams unite* and raise concerns in unison, we will be *taken for granted* by the estate.

The only solution is replacement and Nimbus management won't replace it before we take a strong step against them. Similarly expansion joints issue as well. They are just passing time and trying to sell the remaining units and run away from here. IT'S NOW OR NEVER SITUATION IN FRONT OF US NOW.

Today one of the maintenance team member came to get a closer from me on L tower lift issues. I have mentioned a remark on the complaint slip that lets watch the performance of L tower both lifts for atleast next 1 week from now and see if frequent breakdowns issue still persist or not. Then we can close the complaint. 

I request L tower residents to share the lift issue here immediately if any of the lift malfunctions. So that open lift complaint can be actioned accordingly.

THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS CONCERN NOW WHICH WE ARE FACING CONTINUOUSLY, AGAIN WE FACED A ISSUE AS SOMEONE AGAIN DRAINED PETROL FROM OUR BIKE, WE ARE HIGHLIGHTING THIS ISSUE TO THE MAINTAINENCE TEAM BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE MAINTAINENCE TEAM IS SLEEPING. ARE WE LIVING IN A EDUCATED SOCIETY WHERE THESE KIND OF CHEAP THEFT IS GOING ON CONTINUIOUSLY AND THE MAINTAINENCE TEAM IS NOT EVEN BOTHERED TO LOOK INTO THIS CASES. LAST TIME SAME THING HAPPENED AND THE MAINTAINENCE TEAM COMMITTED TO PAY FOR OUR LOSS WHICH THEY DIDNT PAID AS WELL. SINCE IT WAS 1ST TIME WE THOUGHT TO LEAVE THAT ISSUE BUT THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN AS WELL. IF THE MAINTAINENCE TEAM WILL FIND A SOLUTION OR PAY FOR OUR LOSS THEN I SUPPOSE WE WILL NEED THE OF POLICE TO CLOSE THIS ISSUE. THESE ARE A REGULAR PRACTICE NOW AND CANT BE IGNORED THIS IS HAPPENING WITH ME TODAY IT CAN HAPPEN WITH EVERYONE IN THE SOCIETY IF THE MAINTAINENCE TEAM WILL NOT FIND A CLOSURE FOR THIS KIND OF OPEN THEFT GOING ON IN THE SOCITY

NIMBUS MAINTAINENCE AND MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THIS AND FIND A CLOSURE FOR THESE KIND OF ISSUES. WE JUST CANT LET THINGS HAPPEN EASILY, TODAY PETROL IS TAKEN OUT TOMORROW THE BIKE OR CAR WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE COMPOUND.

In K tower shaft, opposite to my flat wall there is pipe leakage and was reported two weeks earlier.
Still awaiting to get it rectified since seepage started taking over whole wall of adjacent flat which eventually will reach to my flat wall as well...

This is further to inform that due to same reason, my bedroom wall is still having seepage effect and pending for paint by you guys. 

Kindly get it done at urgent basis pls

[27/07/22, 8:37:53 PM] ‪+91 95601 80807‬: This is jitendra and  would like to introduce myself as a resident of tower k1-1201, this is again to inform the maintainence team regarding drainage of petrol from my bike, this is the 2nd instance where we have faced such kind of nuisance. Same thing happened in early march also and during that time the maintainance team committed and promised that such kind of activities will not be entertained in the future and proper actions will be taken to restrict these kind of activities. 
Still if i see the maintainence team dont have value for their own words, 
In the morning ny wife informed regarding these incident and still the carelessness shown by the maintainence team is commendable that they didnt even bothered to reply or ask about the loss which we had faced twice.
Previously during march episode they told that any loss faced by the resident due to security negligence  will be covered by the maintainance team which didnt happened and we believed that they have taken actions and closed the episode but we were wrong and the same thing took place again today.
We are surprised that ghe maintainence team is still not bothered to discuss this matter. 
Are we here in this group to listen to the losses of reaidents or is there any chances of finding oht resolutions as well.
Just a querry what i think is that if this group is created then we all are responsible to make a good society for our future and if we all will keep quiet then we should be ready for further more serious incidenta and losses.
Thanks

[27/07/22, 9:10:45 PM] ‪+91 88003 86258‬: I think why dont we all gather to the maintenance office this Saturday and get all these things discussed and sorted then and there. Last Saturday, very few people gathered to discuss lift issues and now we have much more crucial issues related to security in the society. Please see if we all can gather this Saturday with fullest number and discuss things in-person with security and maintenance team. I am sure things will not be sorted in Whatsapp and its right time to show concerns and frustrations in-person.
[27/07/22, 9:12:33 PM] Anshuman Chatterjee: Problem is when you ask owners to come on ground, there will be only 5-6 persons who seem to be available.

[29/07/22, 8:43:38 AM] ‪+91 98732 49363‬: 2 + study got 3kv load only.
[29/07/22, 8:44:08 AM] ‪+91 98732 49363‬: Mai bhai aapna drainage pipe aise he latka du?
[29/07/22, 8:44:49 AM] ‪+91 98732 49363‬: What are you doing on this? We need a response.
[29/07/22, 8:45:51 AM] ‪+91 84476 39569‬: I mean there are typically 3 main rooms the living, and 2 bedrooms shouldn't it hage enough to support one in each ?
[29/07/22, 8:46:11 AM] Anshuman Chatterjee: Naah. And that depends on the AC. At peak time, they take a lot of power. In 2+1 default is 3 or 4 KVA. I increased it to 5 KVA and have 3 Inverter AC with 5 star rating. That works alright. But only condition is don’t start 3 ACs simultaneously. Give a 5 minutes gap so that the peak requirement during the boot up is staggered.
[29/07/22, 8:46:48 AM] ‪+91 84476 39569‬: What is the process to increase the load
[29/07/22, 8:47:21 AM] ‪+91 84476 39569‬: Mine both are inverter and 5 star too
[29/07/22, 8:47:55 AM] Anshuman Chatterjee: Increasing the KVA load will take Rs 1000/- per kva one time. And then Rs 110/- per month per kva.

Go to girdhar ji in Maintainence. It is a 5 min task only as we already have 3phase connections at each house.
[29/07/22, 8:48:01 AM] ‪+91 98732 49363‬: Meet Girdhar ji in maintenance office, fee is Rs. 1000 per additional KVA. Also your monthly electricity bill permanent change will also increase by 110 per KVA
[29/07/22, 8:48:33 AM] Manoj Kumar Maintainence: Dear sir,
